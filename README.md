Jenkins is a free and open-source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery — Wikipedia

Jenkins provides a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) system proving hundreds of plugins to build, deploy and automate software projects.

Jenkins to automatically detect code commit in a repository and automatically trigger commands either building a Docker image from a Dockerfile, running unit tests, push an image to a container registry or deploy it to the production server without manually doing anything.

One example is when we train a machine learning model, it is necessary to continuously test the models for accuracy. This task can be fully automated using Jenkins. When we work on a data science project, we usually spend some time increasing model accuracy and then when we are satisfied we deploy the application to production serving it as an API. Let’s say our model accuracy is 85%. After a few days or weeks, we decide to tune some hyperparameters and add some more data in order to improve the model accuracy. Then, we plan to deploy it in production and to do it we need to spend some efforts to build, test and deploy again the model which can be a lot of work depending on the context and environments. This is where the open source automation server, Jenkins, comes in.
